   >>>> then scroll up to: "Enter the path to your web app source code" , and before this, start a console first, in order to get

  >>> Reload the web app
  >>> Turn off debug mode on settings.py >>DEBUG=False (This could have been done earlier before running the web app)
  >>> on settings.py file, Allowed hosts = ['moryso2020.pythonanywhere.com'] >> this is under files to your app
